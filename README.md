We are going to solve  algorithmic challenges ðŸ˜Ž

Try to approach each challenge as an exercise rather than just a question. The primary goal is to boost your creativity. These challenges are mostly gathered from competitive programming contests and interview questions, but occasionally, I will personally design them for you if necessary. I will also mention the source of the questions, so you can refer to the original source if you want to learn more.

## Structure of Each Challenge
Each challenge will be uploaded here in Markdown format. A challenge consists of the following sections:

Section |	Description
:- | :-
Name | Each challenge will have a name (you donâ€™t say!). Next to the name, youâ€™ll find the time limit (e.g., 1s) and the memory limit (e.g., 64MB). These two pieces of information will become important for you later.
Context | The main part of the challenge where the problem is presented. It might narrate a long story, but itâ€™s your skill to convert that story into a programming problem.
Input/Output | Your program will receive some data and produce an output. The format is important, and it will be clearly defined here.
Example(s)	| To provide clarity, a problem usually includes examples to help you better understand the requirements.
Note(s) | For additional clarity, one example is usually explained in detail to show you the process.

## How to send solutions?

You will be given access to create your own branch to solve the problems and push your solutions. At the end, create a Pull Request (PR), and I will review and merge it.

Every Monday, I will upload a new question here, and you will have until Friday midnight (12:00 AM) to solve it.

To get the most out of GitHub, an issue will be created each week to discuss the challenge. At the end of the week, the solution to the challenge will be commented on the issue page.

> [!NOTE]
> - There are no restrictions on using a specific programming language. You can use any language you prefer. However, C++ is the most commonly used language in this field, as it offers more functionalities, options, and higher speed compared to languages like Python.
> - Itâ€™s preferable to upload only one file named **solution**. For example: `solution.js` or `solution.cpp`.
