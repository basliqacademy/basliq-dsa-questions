#  Find Ata<sup>(1s, 256MB)</sup>

Hey everyone! This mini question is designed by me to get you ready for the next one. Let’s have some fun with Ata (Mr. Pirahesh’s favorite).

As I mentioned last night, I was reading the Database booklet and noticed that there are plenty of examples with the name “AmirAta Faraji” in them! I 
got frustrated and complained about it, but Ata denied it and insisted that the word “AmirAta Faraji” isn’t in any of the examples. He even went as far as 
saying that I’m the most jealous person on the planet!

I couldn’t calm down, so I tried to find the name “AmirAta Faraji” to prove him wrong. However, due to the late hour and my tiredness, I couldn’t concentrate enough to find it. Now, I need your help. How?

I’ll give you a text, and your mission is to find the name `AmirAta Faraji`. Be careful with the capitalization, because if you don’t, Ata will go 
into DABBE mode! (That means variations like `amirata faraji` or `aMiRaTa fArAJI` won’t count as the name).

### Input

The only line consist of the string `s` indicating the text inside the booklet.

### Output

If there are at least one word `AmirAta Faraji` inside the string, print  `Yes`. otherwise print `No`.
